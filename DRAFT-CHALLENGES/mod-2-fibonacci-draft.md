# Fibonacci Challenge

### Introduction
The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers:
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...
The next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it.
Example: the next number in the sequence above is 21+34 = 55

### The Problem Statement
We want to write a function that takes n as an argument and prints the nth Fibonacci number in the sequence.

### Example
Here are some example inputs and their expected return values:

If n = 1, output should be 1
If n = 2, output should be 1
If n > 2, output should be sum of the previous two values

```ruby
def fibonacci(n)

end
```

### Bonus
How could we refactor your solution to use recursion?
