# Spreadsheet Savior (Review)

This is a review outline for [mod-3-checksum](#) (currently dead link)

### Guidelines for Review
- Explain how to break down a big problem into smaller problems
  - **Problem Statement**: The checksum is a sum of differences, we can break it into 3 smaller problems
  - How do I sum the differences of each row?
    - **Smaller Problem**: How do I compute the difference of a maximum and minimum of a given list/array?
    - **Smaller Problem**: How do I compute the maximum of a given list/array?
    - **Smaller Problem**: How do I compute the minimum of a given list/array?

Students may iterate different ways over the given data, that's okay! Make sure
that they do that step properly otherwise they may hit a pitfall.
